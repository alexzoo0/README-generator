  ## Project description:
  For this project we were asked to create an app that would write a README file based on prompt questions asked the command line. With the help of node.js, the user will be propeted with questions to create the README file. As the user is writing down the answers to the questions in the command line they will be visable in the command line. Once questions answered the user will be presnetd with a finished README file within the folder of this project. Never has it been easier to write a readme.
